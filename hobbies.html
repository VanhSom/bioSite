            <h2>Visiting Zoos and Aquariums</h2>
            <img src="images/HobbiesZoo.JPEG" alt="Visiting Zoos and Aquariums">
            <p>Exploring zoos and aquariums is my cherished pastime, and the Omaha Zoo holds a special place in my heart. Nestled in Nebraska, it offers a sanctuary where I can marvel at wildlife from across the globe. The indoor aquarium is a standout feature, showcasing vibrant marine life in an enchanting undersea setting. Beyond the aquatic wonders, the zoo's exhibits highlight diverse terrestrial species, providing valuable insights into our planet's beauty. The zoo's emphasis on conservation and education resonates deeply with me, strengthening my dedication to preserving our natural world.</p>

            <h2>Choir</h2>
            <img src="images/HobbiesStage.JPEG" alt="Choir">
            <p>Music has been central to my life through school ensembles. Over seven years, I've dedicated myself to choir, winning grand champion twice with our show choir. As a member of Roosevelt Executive Suite and Roosevelt Capital Harmony, I've honed my skills and learned the value of dedication. The demands of show choir require extensive practice and commitment in rehearsals and competitions across different states. These experiences have shaped my journey, offering growth as a musician and team player. Winning grand champion multiple times showcases our collective passion for music and the power of teamwork.</p>
